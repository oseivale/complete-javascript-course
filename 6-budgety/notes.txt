Our apps to-do list

	-adding an event handler

	-get data out of input fields

	-data will be printed to UI, add new item to our data structure

	-Add the new item to the UI

	-calculate the budget

	-Update the UI

	Structuring our code through the use of modules

		They are an important aspect of any robust applications architecture

		They keep the units of code for a project both cleanly separated and organized

		They allow us to encapsulate some data into privacy and expose other data publicly 

		we can break up code into logical parts and make them interact with each other

		With our app, some tasks deal more with UI, and some deal with data

		UI module:

		Get input values
		add the new item to the UI
		Update the UI

		Data module:
		Add the new item to our data structure
		Calculate the budget

		Controller Module:
		Add event handler --> goal is to control the entire app, and also form a connection between the UI and Data modules --> MVC structure :)

		How do we use a module pattern in JS and how do we implement it?

		what is private and piublic data

		what does it mean to expose methods and what is encapsulation and separation of concerns

		we use modules because we want to keep code that is related to each other, separate and independent, in order keep things clean and organized

		in each module, we will have variables and function that are private and can only be accessed within the module

		Use of module pattern to create modules in JS
		the module pattern follows a very basic MVC architecture, which basically has separate UI, Data modules that are connected in a main app module through IFFE's (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)

		How to read data from different input types
